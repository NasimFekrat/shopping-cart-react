# Shopping Cart React Project

This repository showcases my skills in building a React frontend for a simple online shopping cart application. The project is primarily focused on the frontend development aspect, and no backend implementation is included. As a result, some features, such as the checkout button on the cart page, are not functional and are included for design purposes only.

## Project Overview

This project simulates an online shopping experience using the following technologies:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**: For managing navigation and routing within the application.
- **Bootstrap**: A popular CSS framework for designing responsive web pages.
- **Phosphor React**: A flexible icon library for React applications.

You can view the live project here: [Shopping Cart React Project](https://NasimFekrat.github.io/shopping-cart-react).

## Features

- **Product Listing**: Browse through a selection of products with details such as price and description.
- **Add to Cart**: Easily add products to your shopping cart.
- **View Cart**: See a summary of the items in your cart with total pricing.
- **Checkout Button**: Present on the cart page, though non-functional due to the absence of backend integration.
